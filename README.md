Comparison of Galin engine to single cylinder reciprocating piston engine.

In the code below we simulate the power stroke process of both types of cylinders. Keep in mind that during normal operation, the cylinder of a reciprocating piston (RP) engine will only output 1 power stroke for every two full rotations of the crankshaft. Whereas in Galin engine, every rotation of the vanes can produce 4 power strokes. Additionally, in Galin engine the power stroke and compression strokes occur at the same time, but in our simulations provided below we don't include the compression stroke - to make it comparible to the power stroke in the RP engine. 

Both engines are sized to have maximum cylinder volume of 27 mL and compression ratio of 9. 
Both engines have an ignition event occur at time zero, which immediately raises the temperature and pressures to:
